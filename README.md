## List 
## A} ArrayList
1. Dynamic array/  resizable-arrays
2. The order of elements is preserved as Insertion order.
3. You can add null elements.
4. Allows duplicate values.

## B} LinkedList 
1. Doubly Linked List.
2. The order of elements is preserved as Insertion order.
3. Allows Duplicates and Null values.

## C} Vector 
1. Dynamics array like ArrayList.
2. It is synchronized - Use in a Multi-threaded environment.

## D} Stack
1. Follows Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
2. It can be implemented using Arrays or Linked Lists.

## Queue
## A}PriorityQueue
1. Follows First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
2. The order of elements as priority.

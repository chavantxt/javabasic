## List 
## A} ArrayList
1. Dynamic array/  resizable-arrays
2. The order of elements is preserved as Insertion order.
3. You can add null elements.
4. Allows duplicate values.

## B} LinkedList 
1. Doubly Linked List.
2. The order of elements is preserved as Insertion order.
3. Allows Duplicates and Null values.

## C} Vector 
1. Dynamics array like ArrayList.
2. It is synchronized - Use in a Multi-threaded environment.

## D} Stack
1. Follows Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
2. It can be implemented using Arrays or Linked Lists.

## Queue
## A}PriorityQueue
1. Follows First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
2. The order of elements as priority.
3. Can Implement Min/Max Heap, Balanced Binary Search Tree, and Sorted List.
4. PriorityQueue doesn't allow null values to be stored in the queue.
5. Allows duplicate Elements.

## B} Dequeue 
1. Double-ended queue (deque) that is implemented using an array.
2. Efficiency, Dynamic Array, Double-Ended.
3. Sliding Window Problems, Task Scheduling, Palindrome Checking.
4. The ArrayDeque class does not allow null values.
5. Allows duplicate Elements.
